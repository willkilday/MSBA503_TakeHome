This take home consists of two parts. 

Part 1 is Object Detection
Using YOLO, R-CNN, and SSD to detect objects among 9 images. Each model's performance is evaluated based on inference time, number of objects detected, and object labels assigned.
File Names:
YOLO
R-CNN
SSD

Part 2 is Scene Analysis
Using a deep learning model to identify the 9 items more accurately than Part 1. The output shows probabilties of indentified items.
